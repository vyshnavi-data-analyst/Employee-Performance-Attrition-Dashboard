# Employee-Performance-Attrition-Dashboard
Employee Attrition &amp; Performance Analysis using Python and Power BI

**📊 Employee Attrition & Performance Analysis**

This project focuses on analyzing employee workforce data to uncover attrition patterns, performance trends, and department-level insights. Using Python for data preparation and Power BI for visualization, the project demonstrates how raw HR data can be transformed into actionable business insights.

The primary goal was to convert unstructured employee records into a clean, analysis-ready dataset and develop key workforce metrics that help evaluate employee performance and turnover.

**🎯 Project Objective**

1.Employee performance and attrition are critical factors in workforce planning. This project was designed to:

2.Understand how performance varies across departments and managers

3.Identify trends in employee performance over time

4.Measure overall attrition within the organization

5.Prepare structured data suitable for business intelligence reporting

**🔧 Tools & Technologies**

1.Python (Pandas) was used for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering

2.Openpyxl was used to read raw Excel data and export processed datasets

3.Power BI was used to build an interactive dashboard for workforce insights

**🧹 Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**

The raw dataset included employee demographics, job roles, monthly performance scores, and employment status. To make the data suitable for analysis, several preprocessing steps were performed:

1.Standardized column names and data formats

2.Converted date fields such as hire and exit dates into datetime format

3.Converted performance scores, age, and experience into numeric types

4.Created new analytical features including:

Average performance score across all months

Employee tenure in years

Attrition indicator showing whether an employee has exited

These steps ensured the dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for analytical modeling and reporting.

**📈 Analysis & Insights**

The cleaned dataset was analyzed to extract meaningful workforce insights:

1.Compared average performance across departments to identify high and low performing teams

2.Measured monthly performance trends to observe workforce productivity changes over time

3.Evaluated manager-level performance based on team averages

4.Calculated the overall attrition rate to understand employee turnover

These insights reflect real-world HR analytics practices used to monitor organizational performance.

**📊 Dashboard Outcome**

The final dataset was used to build a Power BI dashboard that presents:

1.Key attrition and workforce KPIs

2.Performance trends and comparisons

3.Department-level insights

The dashboard converts analytical results into clear, decision-support visuals for business stakeholders.

**🎯 Key Skills Demonstrated**

This project highlights essential data analyst capabilities:

1.Data cleaning and preprocessing

2.Feature engineering for business metrics

3.Aggregation and performance analysis

4.Preparing structured data for dashboard reporting

5.Communicating insights through data visualization

**🎯 Project Outcome**

This project successfully transformed raw employee data into structured workforce insights that support performance evaluation and attrition monitoring.

Through this analysis:

Workforce data was cleaned and standardized to create a reliable, analysis-ready dataset

Key HR metrics such as average performance, employee tenure, and attrition rate were engineered

Performance differences across departments and managers were identified

Monthly performance trends were analyzed to understand productivity patterns over time

The final Power BI dashboard demonstrates how data can be used to convert employee records into clear, actionable insights for workforce planning and decision-making.
